  <h1 class="airy-heading">Why airy is not for speculation</h1>
  <p class="airy-subheading">airy is not a coin.<br/>airy is a rhythm.</p>
  <p>airy was not created to enrich the early or exploit the late. airy refuses velocity-based extraction. There is no trading advantage, no hidden pool, no pre-sale.</p>
  <p>airy rewards contribution, coherence, timing, and intent — not leverage. airy is for builders. airy is for breath.</p>
